        Lordy, I ate a lot this year, particularly since experiencing FR recipe developer Paul Harrison's patented In-N-Out grilled cheese. It's not actually patented — you can't patent a grilled cheese, let alone one that someone else created. Below are Food Republic's top recipes of 2015, from the trendy (hot chicken) to the highly unusual (Everything Bagel Nigiri) to the just plain awesome (Ukrainian garlic bread). The selections span contributions from A-list chefs like Daniel Humm and Jamie Bissonnette to our own recipe developer team.
