        Lordy, I ate a lot this year, particularly since experiencing FR recipe developer Paul Harrison's patented In-N-Out grilled cheese. It's not actually patented — you can't patent a grilled cheese, let alone one that someone else created. Below are Food Republic's top recipes of 2015, from the trendy (hot chicken) to the highly unusual (Everything Bagel Nigiri) to the just plain awesome (Ukrainian garlic bread). The selections span contributions from A-list chefs like Daniel Humm and Jamie Bissonnette to our own recipe developer team.

    <h2>Boiled Pork Belly With Spicy Garlic Dressing</h2>
    <p>Pork belly is beloved by the Chinese. This is the dish that truly serves up the natural fresh taste of pork — except in Sichuan, they just can't help but add a garlic and chile sauce to kick up the taste and heat! </p>

    <h2>Everything Bagel Nigiri</h2>
    <p>While my desire to eat with the utmost authenticity was a great way to learn, it wasn't always very fun. Somewhere along the way, I realized that "fun" is just as important as "fine" when it comes to eating and even more so in cooking. With this in mind, I present this highly sacrilegious snack, a tricked-out sushi-bar version of a bagel and lox.</p>

    <h2>Spicy Moroccan Carrot Salad</h2>
    <p>This recipe has sentimental meaning for me — it is an ode to my childhood nanny, Sol. Both of my parents worked full-time, so for the first eight years of my life, my sisters and I were like Sol's adopted children. Sol came to Israel from Morocco in the mid-1950s, and years later, thankfully, she found her way to the Ronnen household. Her cooking was so different from the food we knew. Sol's was laced with chilies and spices, and her carrot salad was a mainstay on the table.</p>

    <h2>The Humm Dog With Bacon, Black Truffle And Celery</h2>
    <p>The culinary and creative minds behind Eleven Madison Park (plus legendary mixologist Leo Robitschek) come together once more for The NoMad Cookbook, a collection of recipes from the beloved New York City hotel restaurant. And hey, just because the food's fancy doesn't mean a bacon-wrapped hot dog can't make an appearance... as long as it's smeared with truffle mayonnaise and topped with Gruyère and a meticulously prepared celery relish that involves both celery and celery root.</p>
    
    <h2>Sea Urchin Guacamole Tacos</h2>
    <p>This taco was born out of a shared opinion among my cooks and friends that a tortilla is as worthy of precious ingredients as any piece of Raynaud china. When I thought about making a sea urchin taco, I knew that working it into guacamole would magnify the briny sweetness the spiky creature is known for — the fat in an avocado can help stretch and carry flavors just like a knob of butter. Its lobes (sometimes called "tongues") show up three times in this taco: mashed with avocado, piled on top of the guacamole in a bright orange heap, and combined with chipotle and lime juice in a simple salsa.</p>
